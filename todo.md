# Comprehensive System Enhancement Proposal - Master TODO

## Current Status: Deep Analysis Phase

### Completed Analysis
- [x] Examined current architecture (60 Python files, 12K+ lines)
- [x] Reviewed existing phases (planning, coding, qa, debugging, investigation, documentation, project_planning)
- [x] Analyzed tool ecosystem (TOOLS_PLANNING, TOOLS_CODING, TOOLS_QA, TOOLS_DEBUGGING, TOOLS_MONITORING)
- [x] Studied specialist system (4 specialists: Whitespace, Syntax, Pattern, Root Cause)
- [x] Reviewed multi-agent research (Centralized, Decentralized, Hierarchical, Hybrid architectures)
- [x] Examined current server configuration (ollama01, ollama02 - but only ollama02 actively used)

### Critical Findings
1. **Single Server Usage**: Despite having 2 servers, system primarily uses ollama02
2. **Limited Tool Ecosystem**: Missing file structure analysis, schema inspection, call flow tracing
3. **No Loop Detection**: System cannot detect infinite loops or circular dependencies
4. **No Architect Role**: Missing high-level system design and coordination
5. **No Prompt Specialist**: No dynamic prompt optimization or creation
6. **No Role Specialist**: Cannot create custom roles on-demand
7. **Limited FunctionGemma Usage**: Only used for routing and tool formatting
8. **No Custom Tool Creation**: Cannot dynamically create tools during execution

### Proposal Development Plan
- [ ] Phase 1: Foundation & Analysis Tools (PHASE_1_FOUNDATION.md)
- [ ] Phase 2: Multi-Agent Architecture Enhancement (PHASE_2_ARCHITECTURE.md)
- [ ] Phase 3: Specialist Roles & Dynamic Systems (PHASE_3_SPECIALISTS.md)
- [ ] Phase 4: Tool Development Framework (PHASE_4_TOOLS.md)
- [ ] Phase 5: Multi-Server Orchestration (PHASE_5_SERVERS.md)
- [ ] Phase 6: Integration & Testing (PHASE_6_INTEGRATION.md)
- [ ] Main Proposal: PROPOSAL.md (references all phases)

### Next Actions
1. Create comprehensive PROPOSAL.md with executive summary
2. Create detailed phase files with implementation steps
3. Address all questions and concerns
4. Validate technical feasibility
5. Create execution roadmap
