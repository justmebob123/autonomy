# AI Activity Logging

## Overview

The debug/QA mode now includes **real-time AI activity logging** that shows exactly what the AI is doing as it works to fix errors. This provides full visibility into the AI's decision-making process and helps you monitor progress.

## What You'll See

### Real-Time Activity Reports

As the AI works, you'll see formatted activity logs like this:

```
🔧 [AI Activity] Modifying file: src/main.py
   └─ Operation: str_replace
   └─ Replacing: old_method_name...
   └─ With: new_method_name...

📖 [AI Activity] Reading file: src/utils.py

🔍 [AI Activity] Searching code
   └─ Pattern: class PipelineCoordinator
   └─ Files: **/*.py

📁 [AI Activity] Listing directory: src/pipeline
```

### Activity Summary

At the end of each debugging iteration, you'll see a summary:

```
📊 AI Activity Summary (5 actions):
============================================================
  modify_python_file: 2 call(s)
  read_file: 2 call(s)
  search_code: 1 call(s)
============================================================
```

## Tool Icons

Each tool has a distinctive emoji icon for quick visual identification:

| Icon | Tool | Purpose |
|------|------|---------|
| 🔧 | `modify_python_file` | Editing/fixing code |
| 📖 | `read_file` | Reading file contents |
| 🔍 | `search_code` | Searching for patterns |
| 📁 | `list_directory` | Exploring directory structure |
| ✨ | `create_file` | Creating new files |
| 🤖 | (generic) | Other tool operations |

## Information Displayed

### For File Modifications (🔧)
- File path being modified
- Operation type (str_replace, insert_after, append)
- Preview of old code being replaced (first 60 chars)
- Preview of new code being inserted (first 60 chars)

### For File Reading (📖)
- File path being read

### For Code Search (🔍)
- Search pattern
- File pattern (which files to search)

### For Directory Listing (📁)
- Directory path being listed

### For File Creation (✨)
- File path being created

## Benefits

1. **Transparency**: See exactly what the AI is doing at each step
2. **Progress Monitoring**: Know when the AI is actively working vs. thinking
3. **Debugging**: Understand why certain files are being modified
4. **Learning**: Observe the AI's problem-solving approach
5. **Confidence**: Verify the AI is working on the right files

## Example Session

Here's what a typical debugging session looks like:

```
[2024-01-15 12:30:45] Starting debugging iteration 1...

🔍 [AI Activity] Searching code
   └─ Pattern: start_phase
   └─ Files: **/*.py

📖 [AI Activity] Reading file: src/job_executor.py

🔧 [AI Activity] Modifying file: src/job_executor.py
   └─ Operation: str_replace
   └─ Replacing: coordinator.start_phase...
   └─ With: coordinator.begin_phase...

📊 AI Activity Summary (3 actions):
============================================================
  modify_python_file: 1 call(s)
  read_file: 1 call(s)
  search_code: 1 call(s)
============================================================

✅ Fixed 1 file(s): src/job_executor.py
```

## Implementation Details

### Location
- Activity logging is implemented in `pipeline/handlers.py`
- The `ToolCallHandler` class tracks all tool calls
- Each tool call is logged with timestamp and arguments

### Storage
- Activities are stored in `handler.activity_log` list
- Each entry contains:
  - `timestamp`: ISO format timestamp
  - `tool`: Tool name
  - `args`: Tool arguments

### Output
- Real-time logging uses Python's `logging` module at INFO level
- Summary is generated by `get_activity_summary()` method
- Displayed after each debugging iteration

## Configuration

Activity logging is **always enabled** in debug/QA mode. No configuration needed.

To see the logs, run with standard output:

```bash
python3 run.py --debug-qa \
  --follow ../my_project/.autonomous_logs/autonomous.log \
  --command "./autonomous ../my_project/" \
  ../test-automation/
```

## Future Enhancements

Possible future additions:
- Activity log file export
- Filtering by tool type
- Timing information (how long each tool call took)
- Success/failure indicators
- Diff preview for file modifications
